# Hugo Demo taught me to use markdown   

This is a basic syntax to show what I have learned so far, don't go anywhere, I would be with you shortly.


        1.   Here is something
        2.   find this in line 5:

            <html>
                <body>
                    <text>Hello world</text>
                </body>
            </html>

        3.  Thats all

- hello
- world
